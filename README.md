## Hw to run things (on local machine)
1. Run cmd on this project's main directory
2. Enter the command `npm install`
3. Wait to install all of the website's dependencies
4. Run `npm audit fix` if asked
5. Enter the command `node server.js`
6. Go to `localhost:3000` via your browser
7. Done! Enjoy the website!

## How to run things (via Heroku with me)
1.  Simply go to `catsallian.herokuapp.com` when the server is on and enjoy :) `note: website has been deactivated as of 2021`
 
## How to run things (via Heroku manually)
1. Make sure the website's properties are properly setup before deployment
2. Set up Heroku's config vars via Settings tab, Make sure that the Config Vars are:

	`MONGODB_URI` : `mongodb+srv://admin:adminpassword@cluster0.h1c1r.mongodb.net/catsallian-database?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

	`NODE_ENV` : `Production`

	`TZ` : `Asia/Singapore`
