- **userController**: handles everything from updating the password of each user, to encrypting their data. without this, you can't even log into the website!
- **postController**: responsible for creating, deleting, updating, and even finding posts
- **commentController**: does all the CRUD actions when it comes to commentsâ€”create, read, update, and delete just through the click of a button!
